## 📊 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze how **individual trading behavior**
(such as trade size and transaction fees) aligns or diverges from overall
**market sentiment (Fear vs Greed Index)**.

The project also demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing
- Dataset merging
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Simple Machine Learning implementation
- Insight generation for smarter trading strategies

---

## 🧠 Datasets Used

1. **Historical Trader Data**
   - Trade size (tokens and USD)
   - Fees
   - Execution price
   - Trade timestamp

2. **Fear & Greed Index**
   - Market sentiment classification (Fear, Greed, etc.)
   - Daily sentiment score

Both datasets are merged using date-based alignment.

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

A simple **Logistic Regression** model is used to classify market sentiment
(Fear vs Greed) based on basic trading features.

This model is intentionally kept simple for:
- Interpretability
- Beginner-level understanding
- Academic clarity

---

## 📈 Outputs

- Cleaned and merged datasets (CSV)
- EDA visualizations (PNG/JPG)
- Feature importance plot
- Final summarized report (`ds_report.pdf`)

---

## 🔗 Colab & GitHub Instructions

- All notebooks are shared as **Google Colab links**
- Access is set to **“Anyone with the link can view”**
- The same directory structure is maintained in the GitHub repository
